\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Social reinforcement can play a crucial role in behavioral adoption.
When the primary function of a behavior is social, such as with Twitter
memes or fashion, the largest factor for whether an individual adopts a
new behavior may be the behaviors in their reference network. We explore
the question of how social network structure and individual factors
affect the propagation of these behaviors. We construct an agent-based
model which allows us to simulate behavior propagation in social
networks. We simulate propagation in networks where two competing
behaviors are present and observe the impacts of population size,
connectivity, initial prevalence, and learning rate on dispersion over
time. We give particular focus to the question of how trends emerge.

\hypertarget{modeling-social-norms}{%
\section{Modeling Social Norms}\label{modeling-social-norms}}

Mathematical modeling of behavior dispersion has been a focus for
researchers across disciplines since the publication of prominent papers
by Mark Granovetter (e.g. ``The Strength of Weak Ties'') in the 1970s.
Granovetter's ``Threshold Models of Collective Behavior'' (1978)
describes a mathematical model through which we can understand the
progression of trends in a population. For a behavior such as rioting,
individuals may have a preference to partake in the behavior which is
conditional on the proportion of their peers who also partake. If there
are 100 people in an area where a riot is forming, and an agent is
willing to join the riot only if 50 or more people have joined, then
their threshold for participation in this model is 50\%. If we know the
distribution of behavior thresholds of a population as well as the
number participating in the behavior at a given time, we can in theory
determine whether a riot will explode or diminish by delineating
discrete time intervals and inductively calculating the proportion that
will join the riot at each interval.

The ability to simulate and model decision-making processes for social
behaviors has greatly increased the specificity and accuracy with which
we can study the dispersion of behaviors and ideas within networks. In
addition to simply modeling the preferences of individuals, we may also
wish to understand the implications of these preferences when they
manifest in a network. If a behavior is becoming popular amongst a
population, the decision of an individual to partake is not simply a
function of the collective population's behavior, but instead of the
behavior of their local reference network, or those who we have some
sort of tangible connection to; it makes no sense that we would be able
to directly imitate behavior of those whose actions are invisible to us.
In a graphical representation of a population, individuals are
represented as nodes and their relationships (whether professional,
platonic, romantic, or digital) are represented as directed or
undirected edges between nodes. The resulting web is the social network
of the population, and the shape it takes can drastically affect the
manner in which ideas disperse.

A particularly challenging task in the study of social norms is
understanding how trends emerge. It is difficult to tell whether a trend
will reach prevalence during its initial stages. By the time a trend has
either propagated or died out, we are restricted to a historical
analysis, which limits our ability to find conclusive results about the
behaviors of the initial trendsetters. Simulation work using agent-based
modeling techniques presents a promising approach for overcoming some of
these difficulties.

The two broad factors related to trendsetting that we can study easily
with our approach are network structure and seeding pattern. These are
difficult factors to study currently in real-world populations, because
we lack the ability to apply experimental treatments to measure their
impacts; it is very difficult to manually seed a network of humans with
a certain idea, and it is essentially impossible to try to forcibly add
or break connections between people to alter the structure of a social
network.

By conducting sufficiently realistic simulations with an agent-based
model, we can begin to formulate hypotheses about the functionality of
trendsetting in practice. These findings may be applicable for a wide
variety of trendsetting efforts that we wish to promote. It may be the
case that broadly introducing new ideas to an entire population is not
the most efficient way to alter norms which we find to be problematic,
such as discrimination or child marriage (Bicchieri, Cristina. ``Norms
in the Wild'', 2016). Instead, we may be able to isolate communities
within the population that are properly positioned in their network to
influence the remainder of the population, and apply a more intense
seeding procedure that results in a higher probability of community
adoption.

\hypertarget{our-model}{%
\section{Our Model}\label{our-model}}

We construct a framework for running simulations of behavior propagation
in a network. Our model has many similarities to work by Nunn et al.
(``Do transmission mechanisms or social systems drive cultural dynamics
in socially structured populations?'', 2009). In their simulations, they
construct an artificial network and run simulations about behavior
adoption, modifying parameters for both the agent and network structure
and observing the effects on propagation. They use 3 transmission models
(random, prestige, and concensus) to vary the way in which agents
imitate from observation. Ours is most similar to their concensus model,
where the number of observations increases the probability of adoption,
but all agents are weighted equally for prestige.

Their simulation focuses on a physical network structure where agents
are placed into fully connected groups, and move to other groups
probabilistically based on geographical proximity. Ours is more in line
with a social network, where connections between any two agents are
explicitly represented as edges. Our clustering specifications allow us
to construct networks quite similar to theirs, but we do not enforce
that clusters are fully connected. The primary aim of their work was to
explore how the different transmission models, as well as parameters
controlling group size, movement, and mortality, affect transmission. In
contrast, we give specific attention to the question of how trends
emerge, and explore which parameter settings result in a high
probability of a new behavior reaching prevalence.

In our simulations, there is a base action (represented numerically as
0) and a target action (represented as 1) which compete for prevalence.
Our aim is to understand how parameters such as population size, initial
prevalence, connectivity, and learning rate affect the prevalence of the
target action over time.

Our agent-based model is a probabilistic variant of a threshold model.
We make the assumption that agents can only learn by observing others in
their reference network. We represent these connections as edges in a
graph, and we treat all edges as equal. We also make the assumption that
an agent's behavior is probabilistic rather than deterministic. Instead
of only acting when a fixed threshold is crossed, agents act with a
probability which increases linearly with the rate of observing the
relevant characteristics in their reference network (i.e.~their
neighbors). In our case, this means that agents are more likely to
engage in the target behavior when more of their neighbors are engaging
in the behavior.

In the simplest version of the model, agents act directly in accordance
with the distribution of actions they witnessed in the previous round.
In the first round of the simulation, agents act according to their
`prior', which is a specified parameter representing the initial
prevalence of the target behavior. This can be modified with the memory
parameter to induce a different learning rate, controlling the speed at
which the initial prior washes out when actions are observed every
round.

In each round, after the network \((V, E)\) is created, actions
\(a_i^t\) in every time step \(t\) are drawn from each agent \(i\)'s
distribution by sampling from a uniform distribution and comparing to
their prior \(p_i^t\) for using the target action at that time. Priors
are then updated by mixing the old prior \(p_i^t\) and the observed
distribution \(o_i^{t+1}\) (from the reference network \(N_i\))
proportionally with memory \(\mu\):

\[X_i^t \sim U(0,1)\]

\[a_i^t = \mathbb{1}(X_i^t \leq p_i^t)\]

\[N_i = \{j : (j, i) \in E\}\]

\[o_i^{t+1} = (\sum_{j \in N_i} a_j^t) ~ / \mid N_i ~ \mid \]

\[p_i^{t+1} = \mu p_i^t + (1 - \mu) o_i^{t+1} \]

Prevalence in each time step \(\pi_t\) is computed as the mean action
value in the network:

\[\pi_t = (\sum_{i \in V} a_i^t)~ / \mid V ~ \mid \]

Number of agents in the network.

\hypertarget{memory-learning-rate}{%

The proportion to which the old prior is maintained when updating after

\hypertarget{clustering}{%

Parameters for controlling the structure of the network. We can specify

clustering coefficient of a network.

\hypertarget{prevalence}{%

Prevalence represents the proportion of agents taking part in the target

\hypertarget{understanding-simulations}{%
\subsection{Understanding Simulations}\label{understanding-simulations}}

For any setting of parameters, we run numerous simulations (typically
100) to ensure we can be relatively confident about the trends we
observe. We visualize our results by displaying the proportion of
simulations resulting in different levels of prevalence at different
times. For every timestep, we show the proportion of trials where
prevalence falling into each of the five quintile bands (e.g.~40-60\%)
as well as the proportion at either 0\% or 100\% prevalence.
Intuitively, this lets us visualize the probabilities of different
outcomes occuring in our simulation. This randomness takes into account
both the randomization within edge construction and from the actions
taken every round.

\hypertarget{our-results}{%
\section{Our Results}\label{our-results}}

Our results present useful guidelines about the tradeoffs of relevant
parameters. For uniformly constructed networks without trendsetters, our
most interesting result is that the prior probability for the target
action is quite close to the proportion of trials where all agents
converge to the target action. Above a threshold for sufficiently large
and connected networks, in nearly every simulation, the observed
proportion of trials reaching full prevalence was approximately equal to
the prior. Upon conducting statistical tests, we preserve the hypothesis
that the prior is equal to the likelihood of convergence to the target
action with statistical significance for several parameter combinations.
All Z values indicate the number of standard deviations our observed
success rate is away from the mean, assuming the prior equals the target
behavior convergence probability: - Baseline w/ Prior = 0.1, 1000
trials: Z = -0.6324555320336759 - Baseline w/ Prior = 0.3, 1000 trials:
Z = -0.2760262237369417 - Baseline w/ Prior = 0.5, 1000 trials: Z =
0.5059644256269407 - Baseline w/ Prior = 0.1, Memory = 0.3, 1000 trials:
Z = -0.5270462766947299 - Baseline w/ Prior = 0.3, Memory = 0.3, 1000
trials: Z = 0.06900655593423542 - Baseline w/ Prior = 0.5, Memory = 0.3,
1000 trials: Z = -0.18973665961010278

We also include clustering and trendsetting as two new dimensions for
modifying our simulations. Including a single trendsetter in a network
with a low prior resulted in the vast majority of simulations converging
to the target behavior relatively quickly, showcasing the impact that
can be had when just one person acts as an influencer rather than
learning from their neighbors. This effect was exacerbated by increasing
the number of trendsetters. While introducing clusters on their own did
not have an interesting effect, we experimented with different
allocations of trendsetters between clusters. We found that spreading
out trendsetters across several clusters resulted in slightly faster
convergence than placing them all within the same cluster.

We acknowledge that our trendsetter model involves an oversimplification
which may be a factor in our results about the effectiveness of
trendsetting. Because trendsetters will never use the base action, and
because our simulation seems to always converge eventually rather than
finding an equilibrium between the two actions, convergence to the
target action is practically guaranteed. However, we can use our results
about prior values to speculate about what would happen if the
trendsetters were to drop out from the network at some point. We
hypothesize that the prevalence of the target behavior at the time of
dropout will be quite close to the target behavior convergence
probability.

\hypertarget{further-work}{%
\section{Further Work}\label{further-work}}

Extensions of this work may include mortality models for trendsetters
and other agents, non-linear functions for prior updating, inclusion of
more than two actions, agent models trained on real data (possibly using
Twitter hashtags), weighted and unidirectional edges, utility models
allowing for more nuanced social learning, prestige values based on
network centrality (possibly computed with PageRank), and simulations on
much larger networks. These additions would allow us to model more
complex and realistic scenarios with higher degrees of accuracy.

Further work in developing more robust and complicated models may allow
us to replicate trend emergence patterns in real-world scenarios with
sufficient degrees of accuracy. In theory, we can study virality within
a school, city, or a small friend group by generating simulations that
model their typical networks structure. We can study the effectiveness
of introducing viral ideas in scale-free networks, small-world networks,
homogenous networks, dense and sparse networks, and networks with high
or low clustering coefficients by defining our initial simulation
network as such. We can also study the comparative success of different
trendsetter seeding strategies, such as seeding an idea heavily within
one large community and hoping it disperses, or seeding in smaller
pockets throughout a network and hoping that they converge. For any
real-world situation where we wish to engage in trendsetting behavior,
we can map the structure of the social network, create an equivalent
simulation, and use the results of various simulated seeding patterns to
inform the actions we take to influence people and shift norms.

There is a growing body of work regarding computational studies of
behavior which we can turn to for inspiration, including recent papers
by Chang and Koban (``Modeling Emotion and Learning of Norms in Social
Interactions'', 2013) and Boloni et al. (``Towards a computational model
of social norms'', 2018). As access to data and powerful computing
resources expands, we should expect the trend of increasingly intricate
and accurate models of human interaction to continue.

\section{A Brief Discussion About Simulation
Performance}\label{a-brief-discussion-about-simulation-performance}}

Initially, I built these simulation tools with Apache Spark's dataframes
and the SparkSQL library. These tools are well-designed for efficient
parallel computation across many servers, but as I ran out of AWS
credits, I was stuck running simulations on my MacBook. The overhead
required by Spark's more intricate data model was heavy enough to become
fairly slow when running moderate-sized jobs without multiple servers,
resulting in ``out of memory'' errors when attempting many of the
computations. To remedy this, I reimplemented the simulation tasks with
simple, lightweight Python data structures (such as a dictionary to
represent the network), taking care to ensure that our population sizes
are small enough such that lack of parallelization is not a major issue.

Somehow, this actually worked and everything runs quite quickly.

The Spark code is available in another notebook in this repository. It
is worth revisiting if we desire to use cloud services to run similar
simulations which require heavier computing resources.

We use a dictionary object to store the relevant parameter values for
our simulations. This dictionary is passed to the build\_network
function which creates another dictionary representing the information
about agents in the network. We give other methods for simulating the
``action'' step and the ``prior update'' step of our simulation, as well
as a method which simulates many rounds at once.

\subsection{Adjusting Initial
Prevalence}\label{adjusting-initial-prevalence}}

The prior parameter represents the initial prevalence of the target
variable. Functionally, it controls the probability that an agent will
exhibit the target behavior in round one. In any subsequent round,
agents will act according to the distribution of action exhibited in
their reference network in the previous round. We fix memory at zero for
these simulations, so there is no mixing between old priors and new
observations. If prior is zero, the target behavior will never be
introduced. If prior is one, base behavior is nonexistent.

We visualize our results for prior values of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5. The
extremal values (0.0, 1.0) result in flat lines at 0\% or 100\%
respectively, as only a single behavior is ever present. We maintain the
baseline parameters for population (100), connectivity (10\%), and
memory (0). We conduct 100 trials of 500 rounds each for the chosen
prior values.

    The simulations with prior \(p\) and \((1 - p)\) are effectively
symmetric for any \(p\). Quite interestingly, the proportion of
simulations where full prevalence is reached appears to track the value
of the prior parameter remarkably closely. Further simulations verified
this general trend up to prior values of 0.95. We will later explore how
this changes under different parameter settings.

\subsection{Adjusting Population Size}\label{adjusting-population-size}}

We conduct simulations with varying population sizes to observe the
effect of population on speed of convergence. We conducted simulations
for a range of values and show our results for networks with 25, 100,
and 250 agents. It appears that convergence (either to the base or
target action) is not guaranteed for populations under 50, and these
smaller populations exhibit higher volatility per round as seen by the
amount of noise in the prevalence graphs. The speed of convergence
appears to slow down gradually as network size grows, yet it still
occurs eventually nonetheless. The lack of convergence in smaller
networks may be a result of a disconnected network. Because we did not
modify our edge probability, it is possible that separate components of
the network each converge on their own to different actions, but there
is no network-wide dominant action.

For these simulations we maintain the baseline parameters for
connectivity (10\%), starting prior (50\%), and memory (0). We conduct

\subsection{Adjusting Connectivity}\label{adjusting-connectivity}}

The networks we are constructing are random, where any undirected edge
between two agents is included with some fixed probability. We explore
the effects of changing this probability on the dispersion of the target
action. We simulate with many values and show our results for
connectivity of 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.25.

Low connectivity appears to have similar results to very small networks,
likely due to the same problem of a disconnected network. Connectivity
values beyond 0.1 do not seem to have a strong impact on prevalence.

For these simulations we maintain the baseline parameters for size
(100), starting prior (50\%), and memory (0). We conduct 100 trials for
500 rounds each.

\subsection{Adjusting Memory}\label{adjusting-memory}}

The memory parameter controls the speed at which an agent learns from
its neighbors. More concretely, memory controls the mixture between the
old prior and the observed distribution when updating an agent's prior.
If memory is 0, the prior will always be set to the observed
distribution in the previous round. If memory is 1, the prior will never
update.

As we can see from the visualizations below for memory values of 0.3,
0.5, and 0.7, increasing memory appears to decrease the speed at which
behaviors disperse, resulting higher proportions of trials falling into
the middle prevalence bands for longer periods of time. For memory
values above 0.7, the proportion of trials for which one of the
behaviors reaches convergence in 500 rounds becomes quite small, but
simulations with longer time horizons confirmed that convergence will
usually occur eventually. As expected, when memory is set to 1, we found
no change in behavior over time, with nearly every trial falling into
the middle band. These results are not entirely surprising, but they
allow us to represent an important behavioral phenomenon. When agents
are less willing to adapt to new observations, favoring what they
already know, new behaviors face more resistance. We will later see how
this interacts with other behaviors.

We maintain the baseline parameters for population (100), connectivity
(10\%), and starting prior (50\%). We conduct 100 trials for 500 rounds
each.

\subsection{Connectivity and Initial
Prevalence}\label{connectivity-and-initial-prevalence}}

As we saw in our simulations where we modified the prior value for
initial prevalence, the proportion of rounds where the target action
reached saturation was strongly correlated with the prior value chosen.
We aim to understand whether this is a general phenomenon or simply a
coincidence caused by our baseline parameters. Due to symmetry between
the two actions, we only explore prior values below 0.5. We increase the
connectivity for networks with prior values of 0.1 and 0.3.

Again it appears that for both lower values for the prior, prevalence of
the target behavior is often much lower until a certain connectivity
threshold is reached (roughly 0.075). For all connectivity levels beyond
this, saturation of the target behavior appears to occur with
probability quite similar to the prior (0.1 or 0.3). Even in a fully
connected network, the probability of convergence to the target behavior
tracks the initial prior with remarkable precision.

We maintain the baseline parameters for memory (0) and starting prior
(50\%). We conduct 100 trials for 500 rounds each. For our simulation on
fully connected networks, we limit the size to 50.

\subsection{Memory and Initial
Prevalence}\label{memory-and-initial-prevalence}}

We also consider the tradeoff between memory and prior. Due to symmetry
between the two actions, we only explore prior values below 0.5. We vary
the memory for networks with prior values of 0.1 and 0.3. Again, we find
that the dominant effect of increasing memory seems to be simply slowing
down the process of convergence. The phenomenon of the prior determining
the likelihood of convergence appears to be consistent. Baseline values
were maintained for the remaining parameters, with the exception of
increasing the time horizon when memory is 0.5.

\subsection{Clusters}\label{clusters}}

Creating clusters in the graph does not appear to drastically affect
convergence. Upon normalizing the likelihoods to result in similar
numbers of edges in the network, we find similar patterns of convergence
in networks of size 100 with 4, 10, and 20 clusters (baseline parameters
for prior and memory). We will further investigate the interaction
between clustering and the location of trendsetters in networks.

\subsection{Trendsetters}\label{trendsetters}}

We are now ready to address the questions regarding the trendsetting
portion of this project. First we introduce the notion of a trendsetter,
which we treat as an agent who aims to make the target behavior reach
convergence in the network. They influence those in their surrounding
network by consistently using the target behavior, so their prior is set
to 1 in every round.

We begin by demonstrating the surprising effectiveness of a single
trendsetter in a network where no one else is using the target behavior.
We set the prior to 0 and keep the remaining parameters at baseline
values. Nearly every simulation converged to the target behavior in 500
rounds, with half of them converging in under 200 rounds. With 5
trendsetters, all simulations converged in under 200 rounds.

\subsection{Trendsetters in Clusters}\label{trendsetters-in-clusters}}

Most real-world networks are not uniformly random and exhibit some
degree of clustering. An important question to answer when considering
the efficacy of trendsetting is the allocation of resources across a
network topology. To investigate this, we consider networks with 10
trendsetters and 10 clusters, and conduct simulations with different
allocations of the trendsetters between clusters. We show our results
for the case when all are in the same cluster, spread between 2
clusters, spread between 5 clusters, and spread between all 10 clusters.
Each of our clusters is completely connected, with 10\% connectivity
between clusters, no prior, and no memory. The differences between the
results are subtle, but we find that placing all trendsetters in the
same cluster is the least efficient allocation. Examining the cascading
changes between the different frequency bands is helpful for
understanding these patterns. Notably, the 40-60\% band diminishes
fastest in the 5-cluster and 10-cluster simulations, followed by the
2-cluster. Examining the round threshold beyond which more than half of
the simulations have converged is useful as well. The 2-cluster
simulation improves beyond the single cluster, and the 5-cluster
simulation shows an improvement as well, but it is more difficult to
discern a further improvement from the 10-cluster simulation.

We also include memory values of 0.3 in simulations with 5 trendsetters,
and find again that spreading trendsetters apart is more effective than
keeping them together in a cluster.

These results suggest that dispersion of trendsetters across a network
may be an effective strategy, particularly for relatively small networks
whose members exhibit copying behavior similar to our model. It is
difficult to comment on whether the strategy of dispersing trendsetters
will work for much larger networks, as the trendsetters in our
simulation are still fairly close in terms of degrees of separation,
even if they are in different clusters.

\subsection{Trendsetters and Initial
Prevalence}\label{trendsetters-and-initial-prevalence}}

We also see that introducing a trendsetter into a network can have a
powerful boosting effect on the existing prior. With a prior of 0.3, the
likelihood of convergence to the target behavior is roughly 0.3 as
described earlier when no trendsetters are present, but the inclusion of
one trendsetter results in nearly every simulation converging to the
target.

\subsection{Drawing Conclusions About
Trendsetting}\label{drawing-conclusions-about-trendsetting}}

While our simulations involving trendsetters provide strong evidence
that small groups of individuals can have powerful effects in a network,
we should keep in mind the limitations of our model when interpreting
these results. We should recall that in nearly every experiment we ran,
each simulation converged to one of the two behaviors eventually, even
if some took longer than others. Due to the way in which agents update
their priors, it is highly unlikely that a network will persist in
equilibrium with both actions, because a slight fluctuation in the
direction of one behavior can set off a cascade of copying resulting in
convergence. Keeping this in mind, we also know that when even a single
trendsetter is present, the network will never fully converge to the
base action because that one trendsetter will never adopt it. Thus, we
should not be too surprised that essentially every simulation converges
to the target behavior when trendsetters are included.

A more realistic variant of the model, which has less of a convergence
guarantee, would be to introduce a mortality rate for agents. This was a
prominent feature of the simulations done by Nunn et al. which we
discussed previously. Another approach would be to weaken the prior for
trendsetters, or to allow them to be influenced to some degree.

While we do not explicitly simulate the case where trendsetters
eventually cease trendsetting, our previous results about priors and
probability of convergence are useful here for speculating about what
might happen. We have seen that when trendsetters are not present, there
is a close connection between the initial prior values and the
likelihood that the target behavior will reach prevalence. If we take
the prior as a representation of the proportion of agents who are
engaging in the target behavior, which is the case in expectation in the
first round, we can predict what will occur trendsetter were to drop out
of the network. The network without trendsetters at this stage would
appear quite similar to a network with the prior set to the current
prevalence, and thus we would expect convergence to occur with
probability roughly equal to the prevalence upon trendsetter dropout. In
our simulation with five trendsetters and no clusters, after about 20
rounds the mean prevalence appears to be approximately 50\%. This
suggests that if the trendsetters were to drop out at this round, or at
least stop overriding the prior updating process, convergence to the
target would likely occur about half the time.

\subsection{Running Additional
Simulations}\label{running-additional-simulations}}

Running the cell below will simulate behavior in a network according to
the specified parameters. The `trendsetters' field can be removed. If
`clusters' is included, `edge\_prob' will have no effect, because
`ingroup' and `outgroup' will control the likelihood for all edges. The
`clusters' field can be removed, and `edge\_prob' will dictate the
inclusion probability for all edges.
